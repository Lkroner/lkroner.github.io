            <h2>Why Is Javascript SO Popular?</h2></section>
            <h6>May 5, 2014</h6>
            	<p>The computer language landscape is ever evolving in the modern tech world. Much like any human trend, computer languages used to develop websites are constantly changing to suite the need for a cutting edge webste, and only the best stick get to stick around. Today I'm looking at the language that has been dubbed by the web development community the most popular computer language, JavaScript.
            	</p>
            	<h4>So you may be wondering, what is Javascript?</h4>
            	<p>Well, JavaScript was first created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. JavaScript is a client and server-side computer scripting language. It can be used across multiple web browsers and is considered essential for developing interactive or animated web designs. It is also used in game development and writing desktop applications. It's not really the most refined language and is considered by many programmers as looking syntantically "messy". So what's all the hub-bub about?	
            	</p>
            	<h4>Why is JS so popular?</h4>	
            	<p><strong>4. Flexible</strong> - JavaScript is the ONLY language you can use to build an entire website, can be used both to create the user interface side which deals with the look and feel of the site(Front End) and the server side which deals with information storage and databases(Back End). Also it's what makes a site interactive and basically transformed the internet by adding this functionality. Now it's ubiquitous with the internet and used on nearly EVERY website out there. 
            	</p>
            	<p><strong>3. Accessible</strong> - Runs in a browser so you don't need to download it in order to use it. All you need is a text editor. Also, it's supported by pretty much any browser out there, giving developers the confidence that they're code will work, no matter what computer it's on. 
            	</p>
            	<p><strong>2. Extensible</strong>  - Javascript can be coupled with many powerful tools that give it a ton of utility: JSON, AJAX, Nodejs, MongoDB, jQuery. These tools take this "messy" looking language to the next level. Nodejs/MongoDB allows for it to be used as a backend language, AJAX gives it optimized loading times and a fabulous user experience, and jQuery gives it an extnesive code library that makes writing complex Javascript much quicker/easier. The tools it can harness are many and powerful in their own right. 
            	</p>
            	<p><strong>1. Simple</strong> - JavaSrcipt has become so widespread because, foremostly, it's easy to learn! It's a syntantically simple language and also has a huge open source community to seek out help from in case you get stuck. 
            	</p>
            	<h4>Take away: JavaScript is popular for it's UTILITY, FLEXIBILY and SIMPLICITY. </h4>
