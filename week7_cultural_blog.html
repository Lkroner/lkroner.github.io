               <h2>Anti-Affirmations</h2>
               <h6>June 6, 2014</h6>
               <h4> 
                This weeks DBC blog prompt: * Revisit your "Affirming your Values" <a href="/week1_cultural_blog.html">blog post</a> and relate it to what you learned about stereotype threat.
              </h4>
              <p>
                I see what you're trying to do here DBC! Trying to prepare me for the times when I will surely doubt myself are you? Well...I'm on to it and into it. With my cohort session beginning in a precious two short weeks I am getting nervous, and excited! 
              </p>
              <p>
                Developing a coping plan for the inevitable moment of self-doubt and possibly under duress of the streotype threat, seems not only smart, but likely very necessary to survive the nine weeks at DBC. So I'm examining my values for strengths and developing some healthy habits to lean on when times get tough. 
              </p>
              <p>
                A few weeks back I was asked to pick a few of what I felt my top values and elaborate on why they were important to me. I chose:<strong>Adventure, Growth, Independence, Confidence, Creative, and Close Relationships</strong>. In revisiting the values, I think they actually lend themselves to the DBC experience. 
              </p>
              <p>
                When in doubt, shifting my view from whatever negative feelings/emotions I am having about myself to focus on my core values is an interesting idea. It's not failure, it's adventure! I may not be right, but I am growing! <strong>I'm not sinking in a pile of work, I'm traversing a beautiful mountain of information!</strong>...Etc. It's all about perspective. 
              </p>
              <p>
                One perscribed tool for beating a bad case of the "Negative Nancies" is affirmations. While affirmations have never really spoken to me, I do think there is something to them. Humans are <a href="http://www.nickkolenda.com/subliminal-messages/">highly susceptible to subliminal messages</a>(mostly because of the placebo effect), so much so they can become beliefs. Affirmations are a kind of way to choose your placebo. The standard ones always seemed a bit too saccharine to me, so I developed a few personal "anti-affirmations" of my own:
                  <ol>
                <li><strong>Aint's nobody got time for that!</strong> - "That" being negative thoughts/actions of your own or others.</li>
                <li><strong>F*ck It.</strong> - ...And believe in yourself! Because why not? Seriously, why not?? No one else is going to if you can't.</li>
                <li><strong>Do what you want.</strong> - This one is self-explanatory. Really listen to yourself. Do what YOU want.</li>
                <li><strong>Just keep swimming, just keep swimming.</strong> - Doesn't matter what you do, just do <em>something</em>. Inaction is a tar pit; it will slowly pull you down.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't be an asshole.</strong> - Be a good friend, be grateful for the people in your life and show them it everyday if you can. Don't be someone else's obstacle(unless they're breaking this rule and trying to hurt puppies or something). Life isn't a competition. I'm on team everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Sit down on the couch.</strong> - Being passionately curious is the ultimate cure for fear of the unknown and a value to which I fully subscribe. That said, it's also A-OK to sit on the couch once in awhile. Why? because next point...</li>
                <li><strong>SLOW. DOWN.(i.e. Take care of yourself)</strong> - This is a biggie, and tends to be the one I'm worse at. The modern world is just too chalked full of things to do and if you say yes to every thing that comes along you're going to self-implode. Good food, good rest, good work and good fun. Shoot for a healthy balance of these and reserve your energy for the things that matter most.</li> 
                  </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                Honestly, I find that my sense of humor and ability to not take things too seriously tends to be my way of perservering. I will strive to not lose sight of my Anti-Affirmations while at DBC and beyond. 
                </p>
