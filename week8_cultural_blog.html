            <p>
             Dev Bootcamp is very big on the concept of "Pair Programming", as they well shoud be. Pair programming, given the right context, has been shown to decrease bugs in code up to 50% and increase creativity. Pair programming is where two programmers will work on the same piece of code together. One programmer will take the "Navigator" role, and will dictate what gets written, while the "Driver" role types out what the Navigator instructs and verbally adds their feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pair programming can go well as long as the two involved are communicating well and respecting each others opinion. In my experience, it is very worth while to "Check-In" before jumping right into coding. Checking-In should involve a few things:
              <ol>
                <li>Asking how the other person is doing and really listen! This way you'll know where they are coming from.</li> 
                <li>Determine what "Driver" and "Navigator" role mean to each person(as this tends to differ from person to person).</li>
                <li>Determine who will "Drive" and who will "Navigate" and if/when you'd liek to switch.</li> 
                <li>Determine how long you'd like to pair. Just in case someone has another engagement you can keep that in mind when tackling and prioritizing tasks.</li> 
              </ol>  
            </p>
            <p>
              This seems to help open up(and keep open!) communications lines for the remainder of the pair session and gets both persons on the same page. Most difficulties, aside from the actual coding itself, comes from misunderstandings related to these four points. For the most part, I find that pairing, is a completely different experience every time. And I always find, especially as a beginner, that I come a way from the session having learned something, whether it be a technique, tool, theory etc. It's almost always a growing experience. As long as each person has something to bring to the table and a good attitude, pairing has been a fun experience!

            <h4>Feedback</h4>
            <p>
              Another large part of the Dev Bootcamp experience is giving and receiving feedback. Feedback is given over a typical "grade" and is determined by "ASK" criteria:
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li><strong>Actionable.</strong> </li>
                <li><strong>Specific.</strong> Try to as specific as possible. For (non-coding)example, "Try working out" is very different than "Take a run 2 times a week." are different levels of specificity.</li>
                <li><strong>Kind.</strong> No this doesn't mean being nice. It means being truthful. If a person is weak in an area, not communicating their ideas well, not beng a team player, so say! Do so in a kind and respectful manner, of course, but giving this feedback, while it might be hard(or pleasant!) to hear, may open the door on some one else's growth and enforce awesome habits.</li>
              </ol>
            <p>
              To ensure that the feedback given meets the "ASK" criteria, we also complete "Metafeedback", in which we rate others feedback on these three points. This way, only quaility feedback ever reaches the recipient. Ultimately, receiving others perspectives and advice on your performance should give you a good gauge of where you are in your learning and what areas you might need to improve on. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking over the feedback I've received from my peer pair sessions I am encouraged about my growth and ability to at least communicate respectfully and clearly with my team mates. And while writing up feedback at the end of a long challenge can sometimes feel like beating a dead horse, it is very nice to hear other peoples perspective of your performance. It's also a good way to reflect of your own performance and think about how you like to work as well. Writing/receiving feedback might not always be pleasureable though as sometimes you may work with someone who is difficult. If you don't speak up though, then who will? 
            </p>
            <p>
              In giving feedback and in pairing: Be courageous and say what you mean, and also be open to what others have to say about you, it may be the difference in ones learning experience.
