            <p>
             Dev Bootcamp is very big on the concept of "Pair Programming", as they well shoud be. Pair programming, given the right context, has been shown to decrease bugs in code up to 50% and increase creativity. Pair programming is where two programmers will work on the same piece of code together. One programmer will take the "Navigator" role, and will dictate what gets written, while the "Driver" role types out what the Navigator instructs and verbally adds their feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
             Pair programming can go well as long as the two involved are communicating well and respecting each others opinion. In my experience, it is very worth while to "Check-In" before jumping right into coding. Checking-In should involve a few things:
              <ol>
                <li>Asking how the other person is doing and really listen! This way you'll know where they are coming from.</li> 
                <li>Determine what "Driver" and "Navigator" role mean to each person(as this tends to differ from person to person).</li>
                <li>Determine who will "Drive" and who will "Navigate" and if/when you'd liek to switch.</li> 
                <li>Determine how long you'd like to pair. Just in case someone has another engagement you can keep that in mind when tackling and prioritizing tasks.</li> 
              </ol>  
            </p>
            <p>
              This seems to help open up(and keep open!) communications lines for the remainder of the pair session and gets both persons on the same page. Most difficulties, aside from the actual coding itself, comes from misunderstandings related to these four points.

              RoR is based on a few core principles:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Convention over Configuration</strong> - Provides good default values, reducing the need to specify program details in every project.</li>
                <li><strong>DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)</strong> - A principle aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures. The DRY principle is stated as "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."</li>
                <li><strong>MVC (Model-View-Controller)</strong> - Is a software architectural pattern for implementing user interfaces</li>
                <li><strong>Active Record Pattern</strong> - An architectural pattern found in software that stores its data in relational databases. The interface of an object conforming to this pattern would include functions such as Insert, Update, and Delete, plus properties that correspond more or less directly to the columns in the underlying database table.</li>
                <li><strong>Restful Web Services</strong> - </li>
              </ul>
