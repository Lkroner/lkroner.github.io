               <h2>What Scares Me Most About Dev Bootcamp?</h2>
                <p>What scares me most about being physically AT DBC: a whole lot, but in a good way. I am very excited to get to the point in the course where I'll be on DBC campus. My fear is getting myself prepared for getting to Phase 1. I'm nervous to be working independently during Phase 0 as you have to be very on top of every thing on your own and completely comfortable reaching out if you run into issues. Reaching out has not historically been one of my finer suites so I'm hoping to break out of my routine a bit there. I am scared not to just to be the "weakest link" in cohort but, more importantly, not pushing myself smart/hard enough to get the full experience out of DBC. 
                </p>
                <p>
                On a larger scale I'm scared about having an uncertain future, especially living in SF, a place that you can not afford to be jobless in for that long. Also I live with my boyfriend and am scared to let him (and myself) down if I don't a) survive the course b) find a job afterward.
