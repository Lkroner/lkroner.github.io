             <h2>The Dev Bootcamp Experience</h2>
                <h4>Based on <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat video</a>, what's your take on the DBC experience? What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
                Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how? Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous? Talk about what came up for you and anything you want in addition to the questions above.
                </h4> 
                <p> 
                My first take is that I am... SO excited about the school and philosophies of DBC. The philosophies were one of the big reasons I decided DBC was right for me. When I was very young I was incredibly lucky to find something I was exceedingly passionate about, soccer. I fell in love with playing it, practicing it, thinking about playing it and it became my life for a full decade. It was not just the sport itself which captured me, but to the amazing experiences it afforded me to share with a group of amazing people. In this I learned two pretty important things:

                <p>
                1. My mentor and coach also supported this "kicthen vs. table" mindset and his favorite saying(which has now become one of mine) was "Luck is where preparation meets opportunity". Life is not a computer, it is NOT an input x = output y situation. But if you work hard at something you have better chance of opportunity finding you than if you aren't. My soccer opportunity, unfortunately did not find me. I was beyond prepared, but my opportunity number did not come up. This was certainly one of the hardest lessons I've had to learn in my life: Just because you work your ass off at something, does NOT mean you will get your opportunity(whatever that may be), but that doesn't mean it won't be worth it. The journey is it's own reward, the work is it's own reward and is never, for naught. It's all an experiment! My experience in soccer, while it did not give me the "y output" I expected gave me a litany of intangible life skills: courage, strength, perserverance against all odds and I am grateful every day(or at least I try to be!).

                2. The other item Shereef talked about "if you want to go far and fast, we go together". This was the other part that resonanted with my soccer experience: It made a HUGE difference being surrounded by like-minded, equally-as-invested, excited-as-all-get-out teammates. I was on crap teams, great teams, in-betweener teams. And the team where we achieved the most(measurably and immeasurably) was when everyone had this mentality and gave it their blood, sweat, and tears. I have yet to find something I could be this committed to, or want to be that committed to cause it was INTENSE. I'm not obsessed with programming, but I do find it interesting and I am excited to see how far my cohort team can take each other in our learning, mostly I'm excited to LEARN and I'm excited to help others learn too. 
                <br>
                So what are my expectations? I am expecting to bring it. And I hope everyone else is too.
