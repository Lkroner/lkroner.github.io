            <h2>Best Practices for Using CSS Selectors: ID vs Class</h2>
            <p>One can define your own HTML selectors in the form of <strong>Class</strong> and <strong>ID</strong> selectors. The benefit of this is that you can have the same HTML element, but present it different depending on its class. When deciding on which selector to use you need should consider these three things:
            <h3>1. Repeated use within the document</h3>
            <p><strong>ID</strong> is used for uniquely identifying elements and can ony be applied once within a document. 
            <strong>Class</strong> is used for identifying an element as being part of a <u>class</u> of elements and can be used as many times as needed within a document.</p>
            <h3>2. Combining class selectors</h3>
            <p></p>
            <h3>3. IDs have a higher specificity than classes </h3>
            <p>Meaning, IDs carry a heavier weight of specificity. So, if a class selector and ID selector were in conflict, the ID selector woul dbe chosen.</p> 
            </p>
            <h3>A few more things to consider</h3>
