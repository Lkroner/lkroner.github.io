            <p> I am having a look at the design of my favorite websites by answering these questions:<br><br>
                *Why is this one of your favorite sites?<br>
                *What area of the site is your eye drawn to when looking at the homepage? Stand back further, what area is your eye drawn to now? Is that area the most important area of the site?<br>
                *How would you describe the website visually? List 5 adjectives. (i.e. "pretty", "elegant", "simple", "dark", "cluttered", "basic" etc)<br>
                *What problem does this website solve? What content does it have?<br>
                *What 5 adjectives would you use to describe the content, focus, and purpose of the site? (i.e. "practical", "fun", "whimsical", "silly", "serious" etc) How does that compare to the adjectives you used to describe the site visually?<br>
                *How easy is it to find what you are looking for from the homepage? How about from another page?<br>
                *How easy is it to browse through all the content of the site?<br>
                *How do you feel after being on the site for a while? (i.e. "bored", "happy", "anxious or hyper", "like I wasted a lot of time" etc)<br>
                *Does the site sell anything? If so, have you purchased any of it? Why or why not?<br>

              <ol>
                <li>Buzzfeed</li>
                  <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Buzzfeed isn't really one of my favorite sites but is a site I like to go to when I just need a fix of some mindless enterntainment. I listed it as one of my favorites because while I try to stay away, I still end up visiting it. I wanted to disect what might make it addictive this from a UX standpoint.</li>
                      <li>Buzzfeed utilizes a lot of red. In their logo, headings, upper right hand corner dot. Red is known to draw the eye and by placing is sporadically about their site I think they are trying to get your eye to ping across and down as much as possible. </li>
                      <li>Loud, bright, busy, colorful, image heavy.</li>
                      <li>This site is developed to fight the problem of boredom whiel at work. It creates a ton of very short and easily digested entertainment.</li>
                      <li>Silly, fun, political, gossip, click bait.</li>
                      <li>Buzzfeed isn't really a place you go to look for specific things. Unless it's those famous quizzes.</li>
                      <li>It's pretty easy to browse through content, which is what the site wants you to do. All of the pages lead to at least 20 other links, matched to relate to whatever your reading to keep you clicking on to the next page.</li>
                      <li>Being on the site too long definitely makes you feel like you've wasted a lot of your time. I try to go there sparingly.</li>
                      <li>Buzzfeed doesn't sell anything but they have a ton of partner websites that they are always trying to sneakily push you too. I'm sure this is how they make their cash.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                <li>Need Supply</li>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>I love need supply not only for it's rad clothes, but their site is easy and clean to use and they have one of the best clothes display templates I've ever used. I will admit to being a moderate online window shopper so this something I noticed immediately about their site.</li>
                      <li>They always have big beautiful images on their landing page and their need supply logo that's white on black(one of the most common combinatiosn for a reason!) jumps out immediately and is readable from a 15 feet.</li>
                      <li>Minimalist, elegant, neutral pallette, simple, clean</li>
                      <li>Need Supply is an online store. It solves the need of finding rad clothing. It presents it's wares really well using high definition images of all their products that you can voom in very close on the really look at the quality of clothes. </li>
                      <li>Rad, minimalist, clothes, lifestyle, hip</li>
                      <li>When I go online shopping I usually have a specific thing in mind that I'm looking for. NS nav bars are on of the clearest I've come across and of course they have a search bar as well like most shops should.</li>
                      <li>It's pretty easy to search through the content. They give you a lot of options: Display less items vs more? Search options within specific categories, check! Their site id very organized.</li>
                      <li>I feel happy surfing their site because they refresh it pretty regularly but never have an overwhelming amount of thigns. It well curated, so you can get through most of the stuff you want to look at quickly without feelign like you've wasted you time.</li>
                      <li>NS definitely sells thing but I haven't baought anything yet because I'm broke lately and their items tend to be a bit more expensive. When I'm allowed to shop again then this would the first online place I would stop at.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                <li>The Bold Italic</li>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The Bold Italic is one of my favorite sites because of a few reasons. First off, the graphic design of it is really fun. They have great artists who make  make specific designs for each of their blog posts and do great info graphics as well. Also, they focus on all SF related topics with a snarky bent. It's a very well executed site.</li>
                      <li>Like Need Supply they too have a black bar at the top that and I find my eye travels to their logo and then around the different pictures on the page. It's funny that I chose two sites that have this black bar at the top. I guess for me as a visitor it's very visually effective.</li>
                      <li>Simple, clean, colorful, big text heading, coordinated</li>
                      <li>It is an entertainment website. It's content is current events in San Francisco and around the bay area.</li>
                      <li>Silly, fun, sarcastic, informational, hip</li>
                      <li>This is a website you just kind of browse through to read stories. So you probably won't go there looking for anything specific except for maybe a story which you could just use the serch box to find.</li>
                      <li>It's pretty easy to browse the site for this reason. They have a page where all of their stories are listed and have content tags if you want to surf a specific topic.</li>
                      <li>After being on it for a while I feel happy and entertained.</li>
                      <li>Sometimes they turn their graphic design into goods that you can buy. They have a shop where you can browse to see their recent makings. I've never really checked out their shop before sine I don't go there with the "shopping" mentality, but they have some cool stuff I would definitely consider buying.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
