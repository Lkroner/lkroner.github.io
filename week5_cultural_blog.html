             <h2>Women In Tech</h2>
             <h6>May 20, 2014</h6>
             <p>
              This week we were asked to look into a problem the tech industry faces. I chose something that hits close to home and is definitely a worry I have in entering this industry: Women in Tech. Or really, the lack thereof. I rustled up a few statistics and current events that help illustrate the implications of the heavily documented gender gap in tech:
              <h4>Problem</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Nationwide <a href"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/04/04/3422975/women-tech-outnumbered/">males in the tech industry outnumber females 7 to 3</a>.</li>
                <li>Women make 88% of what men do in “engineering and engineering technology” and 77% of what men do in <a href="http://danluu.com/gender-gap/">“computer and information sciences”</a>.</li>
                <li>Women hold only about one-quarter of all information technology jobs and nearly half the women in science, engineering and technology jobs quit the field early, according to a report by the <a href="http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/legacy/pdf/NCWIT_TheFacts_rev2010.pdf">National Center for Women and Information Technology.</a></li>
                <li>Research shows that women job candidates are <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/03/12/3396151/women-bias-math-stem/">less likely</a> to get hired even when they have the same skill set as a man up for the position.</li>
                <li>Once hired, women in tech often battle the “brogrammer” workplace culture, often leading to gender exclusion and reinforcement of the industry’s seemingly embedded stereotypes, from facing professional retaliation for <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/03/19/3416013/github-julie-ann-horvath-sexism/">spurning a male coworkers</a> advances to biased policies that overlook issues such as harassment.</li>
                <li>In 2010, the latest year for which Bracy could find data, 89 percent of California companies that got crucial seed funding were founded by men. What percentage were all-female founding teams? <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2013/06/silicon-valley-race-gender-problem-income-inequality">Just three percent.</a></li>
                <li>A <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/01/09/women-and-technology/">recent</a> study by the market research firm Parks Associates found that women’s technology habits outpace men’s; they buy more devices and are more likely to engage in digital activities such as uploading photos or downloading music.</li>
                <li>The separate and equally disparaged <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/techcrunch-disrupt-kicks-off-with-titstare-app-and-fa-1274394925">Titshare</a> and <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/04/29/codebabes_claims_to_teach_code_in_the_most_sexist_way_ever/">CodeBabes</a> fiascos and <a href="http://gizmodo.com/code-dicks-parody-site-is-your-equal-opportunity-answer-1568402128">CodeDicks</a> satirical response.</li>
                <li>In the fast-growing field of computer science, women’s representation has actually <a href="">declined in the last 20 years.</a></li>
                <li>Oh and, other minorities aren't fairing much <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/opinion/too-few-girls-and-minorities-study-tech-subjects.html?_r=0">better</a>.</li>
             </p> 
             <h4>Solutions...?</h4>
             <p>
              Looking at all these stats and some <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/this-is-why-there-arent-enough-women-in-tech-1221929631">hard to read stories</a>, it's difficult not to be a bit itimidated by the culture I'm soon to be entering. Besides always working to your best ability, what else can be done to increase awareness of this disparity and create change? I found a few resources and tips on that as well:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li><strong>Raise Awareness</strong> in the community of this problem and help stop perpetuating the cycle.</li>
              <li>Find/build <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allyson-kapin/cracking-the-boys-club-10_b_143826.html"><strong>role models</strong></a>.</li>
              <li>Create/join <strong>support networks</strong> like <a href="http://girldevelopit.com/">Girl Develop It</a>, <a href"http://www.womenwhocode.com/">Women Who Code</a>, and countless <a href="http://www.womenwhotech.com/resources.html">others</a>. </li>
              <li><strong>Mentor</strong> and encourage the next generation.</li>
            </ul>
              <p>
                Looking through all these stories/articles it seems that awareness is on the rise and this is a movement I am proud to be positively contributing to, which is the most I can do at a individual level... for now. I hope I can continue to help grow a community of diversity and change.
