             <h2>Dealing With Conflict</h2>
             <h6>May 15, 2014</h6> 
                <p>
                 Across all work places, conflict is something that happens regularly and often. If the conflict is left unaddressed, it can lead to stress on the job and leak into the rest of your life. Because of this, learning how to successfully address and overcome any conflict is one of the most important life skills you can have. The first order of facing your conflict is identifying the cause of the conflict. According to psychologists Art Bell and Brett Hart, there are <a href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/eight-causes-conflict.htm">eight common causes of conflict</a>. Once you have identified the root of the situation you have to also consider how you have been responding to the conflict that may be feeding it further. The <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">Compass of Shame</a> breaks down the various ways that we respond to this conflict that may aggravate the issue. Knowing your style of response is important to breaking any bad habits or patterns you may be recirculating.

                 Using these tools I'm going to take a look at a past conflict in my life and see if I can't learn something about my conflict response style and apply some of these methods for the betterment of handling future conflicts.

                 <h4>My Conflict</h4>
                <p>
                 My family is very important to me and recently, for the first time in almost 10 years we are living in the same area again. We can see each other more than a coulpe times a year and this has mostly been great. I love my mom, dad and little brother, but also at times this has brought some strain into my life as well. They very much want to be a part of my life and I feel likewise, however they want more of my time than I have to give to them. This problem has cropped up on several occasions. Holidays especially have become a real issue because I have a boyfriend who also has a family and as we try to spend the holidays together it usually results in us getting pulled in too many directions trying to meet te demands of our seperate families. The sourece of the conflict here is time as a resouce. My boyfriend and I don't have enough to give to our families and they in turn feel jilted because of this. Although this is still an ongoing issue I have responded to it in a few ways. I have directly discussed the conflict with my parents, which has helped their understanding of the situation and they are much moe accomodating to our situation. However since I'm not as close with my boyfriends parents things were not discussed until a recent fight we had on the topic. It didn't go well. Shouting at your boyfriends parents is never a good idea and while I definitely wish we could have discussed it a more calm way, I am actually glad we confronted the issue, instead of burying it like we have been. I have definitely been avoiding the discussion with them and I think that's how this fight cropped up. I am going to try to be more communicative with all my family and boyfriends family about our time expectations and hopefully that will help eleviate this issue.

                  I learned form this experience that when faced with conflict I tend to avoid the issue, which often times can make it worse until it blows up in my face. I would really like to break this habit and will try to implement more communication into my future conflicts to see if that can't help the situation.
