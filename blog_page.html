              Much of my education up until now has been absorbing Ruby the language. However, learning the language is one thing, but what comes after that? What is it used for? I'd heard of "Ruby on Rails" and understood that this was the tool that allowed you to use the language Ruby to build things, but how? How was it connected to Ruby if it wasn't Ruby? If Ruby language is the gem then what do the rails represent?

              Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority underachievement and developed a theory called the "Stereotype Threat." Stereotype threat is not a term I was familiar with at all until today, but learning about very much felt like an "aha" moment.

              The debate between when and where to use what type of programming is one that rages on today. On the two ends of the programming spectrum you have Functional Programming(FP) and Object-Oriented  Programming(OOP).

              This week we were asked to look into a problem the tech industry faces. I chose something that hits close to home and is definitely a worry I have in entering this industry: Women in Tech. Or really, the lack thereof. I rustled up a few statistics and current events that help illustrate the implications of the heavily documented gender gap in tech.

              As you know(or now know!) a Ruby <strong>class</strong> consists mostly of a collection of method definitions. It stores them foremostly for the purpose of having objects created that are instances of that class.
