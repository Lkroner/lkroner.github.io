              Much of my education up until now has been absorbing Ruby the language. However, learning the language is one thing, but what comes after that? What is it used for? I'd heard of "Ruby on Rails" and understood that this was the tool that allowed you to use the language Ruby to build things, but how? How was it connected to Ruby if it wasn't Ruby? If Ruby language is the gem then what do the rails represent?

              When in doubt, shifting my view from whatever negative feelings/emotions I am having about myself to focus on my core values is an interesting idea. It's not failure, it's adventure! I may not be right, but I am growing! <strong>I'm not sinking in a pile of work, I'm traversing a beautiful mountain of information!</strong>...Etc.

              Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority underachievement and developed a theory called the "Stereotype Threat." Stereotype threat is not a term I was familiar with at all until today, but learning about very much felt like an "aha" moment.

              The debate between when and where to use what type of programming is one that rages on today. On the two ends of the programming spectrum you have Functional Programming(FP) and Object-Oriented  Programming(OOP).
