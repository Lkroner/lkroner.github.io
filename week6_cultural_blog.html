             <h2>The Stereotype Threat</h2>
             <h6>May 27, 2014</h6>
             <p>
              Claude M. Steele has spent his life researching minority underachievement and developed a theory called the "Stereotype Threat." Stereotype threat is not a term I was familiar with at all until today, but learning about very much felt like an "aha" moment. 
             </p>
             <p>
              Stereotype threat explains much of the theory through its name; individuals come under threat by any negative stereotypes that might be applicable to their identity(male, female, black, white etc.) in a particular context. These stereotypes are assigned to different identities via the surrounding culture, some good and some bad. Anyone can feel the effects of stereotypes given their identity in a specific context; the older person in a room of highschool kids, the man in a room of woman, the black person in a group of white people. When one is put into a context where one might face issues from their stereotype, one is feeling the Stereotype Threat. 
             </p>
             <p>
              <strong>Steele has been researching the effects of the stereotype threat and found several, possibly counter-intuitive points that surfaced:</strong>
             </p>
             <p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Those who cared the most, those who were most qualified, motivated, and skilled were the ones that were at the highest risk for under-performing when exposed to a stereotype threat. Caring can actually make an individual more vulnerable to the Stereotype effects. <strong>The inidivdual would under perform because they're trying too hard.</strong></li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Those that showed measurable signs of the Stereotype Threat effects were never subjectively aware that they were.</li> 
                  <br>
                  <li>The strength or degree to which a person experiences Stereotype threat depends on the cues in the situation that suggests that you might have things to deal with in that situation because you have a certain identity and can be as subtle as having four mens bathrooms on one floor of the math building and only one womens.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
              Have I ever felt influenced by the Stereotype threat? According to Steele's findings it's probably not something I was conciously aware of at the time if I had. That aside, I'm sure I've come under it's influence at some time or another. I am grateful to have learned about this social phenomena and I think it is very intelligent and important that DBC has sprinkled this and many other social topics throughout the course work. I can see now how many of DBC's practices have Steele's theory in mind and they are actively trying to combat the identity issue. Many of the examples Steele gave to combat the Stereotype threat  I can now see DBC has already implemented in some capacity.
              </p>
              <p>
              For example Steele recommended these actions:
                <ul>
                  <li> <strong>Leadership</strong> - It's starts with leadership to set the tone and expectations. DBC has taken an active role in educating not only themselves but building that into the course work of the student population.</li>
                  <li> <strong>Critical Mass</strong> - Getting the majority of people on the same level of awareness so that they can conciously fight the issue instead of insidiously and maybe accidently feeding it.</li>
                  <li> <strong>Disambiguating Feedback</strong> - So this is what metafeedback and the ASK(Actionable, Specific, Kind) is all about! By having feedback that is anonymous and reviewed for quality DBC is actively trying to disambiguate feedback. I do tend to trust it more.</li>
                  <li> <strong>Fostering Intergourp Conversations between people from Diverse Backgrounds</strong> - DBC's all over this! I thought it was nice that in the beginning of our Phase one we were assigned to share our worst fears about DBC. It really leveled much of the tensions getting to see that basically EVERYONE felt similarly.</li> 
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
              What I thought was most interesting about most of the studies conducted was that they were able to disambiguate the identity issue usually by just a simple statement. All the researchers had to say was, "These are just puzzles not any form of intelligence measurement" or "This test has shown to be equally challenging and shows no biases to any specific identity group." Just awareness alone makes a difference in combating the Stereotype threat! So look alive guys!
