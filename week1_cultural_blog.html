               <h2>Exploring My Values</a></h2>
               <h6>April 22, 2014</h6>
               <h4> 
               * When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?
               </h4>
               <p>
               The words that spoke to me the most: Adventure, Growth, Independence, Confidence, Creative, and Close Relationships. Taking on a new challenge, embarking on a new path, is very exhilerating for me. I hope that I am always able to learn new things and striving to be the best I can in my work and life. Maintaining my close relationships with my family and friends is very important to me through out all pursuits. 
               </p>
               <h4>
               * Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why one of the values you chose is important to you.
               </h4>
               <p>
               Indepedence is a very important value for me. When I was younger I used to think this meant being completely self-sufficient, a self-contained island. As I've gotten older however I've come to realize that true independence is having something to contribute back to those around you. You must build yourself up first, but gaining independence should not take you further from others, it should bring you closer, as you will have something valuable to contribute back.
               </p>
               <h4>
               * Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:
               </h4>
                <p>
                In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
                <br>
                Adventure
                <br>
                Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <strong>4</strong> ----- 5 Agree
                <br>
                Growth
                <br>
                Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <strong>4</strong> ----- 5 Agree
                <br>
                Independence
                <br>
                Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- <strong>4</strong> ----- 5 Agree
                <br>
                Confidence
                <br>
                Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- <strong>3</strong> ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
                <br>
                Creative
                <br>
                Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- <strong>3</strong> ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
                <br>
                Close Relationships
                <br>
                Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- <strong>5</strong> Agree
                <br>
                </p>
                <h4>
                * What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on?
                </h4>
                <p>
                The last topic someone asked me advice on is actually kind of silly. My little brother wanted help picking out an outfit and location for his OKCupid date. He just moved to San Francisco and it's been so much getting to be a part of his life more. Even (especially) if it's helping him decide between the brown or black shoes.
